<h1>Calculator</h1>
<br><p>Just in case I forget to bring my calculator to school (hope this works)</p>
<br>
<h2>Things to note:</h2>
<p>1. You can use the character "a" within calulations to obtain the previous answer (just like how the Ans functions in a typical calculator)</p>
   <p>2. The calculator cannot have multiple operations within a calculation. It is recommended to just use the feature stated before to calculate numbers using multiple operations.</p>
